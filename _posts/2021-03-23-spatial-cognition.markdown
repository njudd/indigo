We set out to answer the question:

 - Does training different types of spatial tasks help kids improve in mathematics?

Spatial and mathematical abilities are strongly associated. Here, we analysed data from 17,648 children, aged 6â€“8 years, who performed 7 weeks of mathematical training together with randomly assigned spatial cognitive training with tasks demanding more spatial manipulation (mental rotation or tangram), maintenance of spatial information (a visuospatial working memory task) or spatial, non-verbal reasoning. We found that the type of cognitive training children performed had a significant impact on mathematical learning, with training of visuospatial working memory and reasoning being the most effective. This large, community-based study shows that spatial cognitive training can result in transfer to academic abilities, and that reasoning ability and maintenance of spatial information is relevant for mathematics learning in young children.

### Brief Overview

Every child completed identical training in the first week, on the 2nd week (out of 7) they were randomized into one of the 5 training plans below. These plans differed on the amounts of working memory, rotation, or non-verbal reasoning exercises.

We measured mathematics at three timepoints with in-app tests (i.e., addition, subtraction & number comparions) which we combined into a latent mathematical factor.

        <p> As expected this mathematical factor was highly correlated with the training tasks. As seen on the training curves below all of the trained tasks signficantly imporved over the seven weeks.</p>

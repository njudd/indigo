<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://lifespancognitivedynamics.com/">Lifespan Cognitive Dynamics lab</a>, before I was a data scientist at <a href="https://www.ru.nl/donders/">Donders Institute</a> for brain, cognition, and behavior where I created the <a href="https://www.njudd.com/raincloud-ggrain/">ggrain</a> R package. I completed a doctoral degree at the Department of Neuroscience at Karolinska Institutet.
</p>

<p>I have a broad set of interests, my research is clustered around studying how we develop our cognitive abilities. Reproducibility, open source (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/copyleft" >copy left</a>), and coding is near and dear to my heart. I love learning new methods and stats. In my research I try to use the design that best matches the question at hand (e.g., longitudinal, experimental, and causal inference).
</p>

<p>I am currently on a temporary contract and <b>open to offers</b> within or outside of academia. It would be cool to collaborate, so don’t hesitate to reach out! 
 </p>

<p>In my free time, I love to rock climb, travel, and surf. Sometimes I get a bit too addicted to podcasts... I grew up in La Jolla, and lived in Dublin, Umeå, Melbourne, Munich, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Nijmegen. Right now I'm in Amsterdam, roommates with <a href="https://brunosauce.net/">Prof. Bruno Saaauce</a>. </p>

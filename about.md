<p>I am a final year Ph.D. student and Karolinska Institute in the lab of <a href="http://www.klingberglab.se/">Torkel Klingberg</a> at the Department of Neuroscience. Currently, I am based at the Donder's Center for brain, cognition, and behavior on a research visit in the lab of  <a href="https://www.rogierkievit.com/">Rogier Kievit</a>. The goal of my research visit is to take a causal approach to covariate correction in neuroimaging analysis. I also aim to pick up more longitudinal structural equation modeling skills while here. </p>

<p>In my free time, I love to rock climb, travel, and surf. Sometimes I get a bit too addicted to podcasts...</p>
